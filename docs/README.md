# MCP Documentation Set

This directory holds the working documentation that chronicles the evolution of the Model Context Protocol. Group content by narrative flow so that future readers can trace what changed, when it changed, and why decisions were made.

## Subdirectories

- `prompts/` — Prompts used to generate reports or research artifacts.
- `research/` — Unprocessed notes, reference links, and transcript excerpts.
- `reports/` — Published documents (including `.docx`) and their Markdown summaries.
- `implementations/` — Analyses of specific MCP implementations, divided into `good/` and `bad/`.
- `spec/` — Annotated specification readings, change logs, and version comparisons.
- `alternatives/` — Competitive or complementary technologies and how they compare to MCP.
- `templates/` — Markdown templates to standardize new contributions.
- `timeline/` — Chronological narratives highlighting major milestones.

Refer contributors back to this file when creating new documentation so structure remains consistent.
