# MCP Implementations

Use this area to catalogue real-world MCP deployments. Split case studies into the `good/` and `bad/` directories to highlight patterns worth emulating or avoiding.

Each case study should include:

- Implementation context (team, product, release timeline).
- Specification version targeted.
- Successes/pitfalls and mapping to specification clauses.
- Lessons learned and follow-up recommendations.
