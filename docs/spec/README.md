# MCP Specification Tracking

Use this folder to document how the upstream MCP specification evolves over time.

## Recommended Artifacts

- `change-log.md` — Running log of changes captured from upstream diffs.
- `release-notes/` — Optional summaries of official releases or tags.
- `crosswalks/` — Mapping between specification revisions and implementation changes.

Whenever you sync the upstream repo (via submodule or script), add a short entry summarizing noteworthy changes.
