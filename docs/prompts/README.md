# Prompt Catalog

Store the exact prompts that generated reports, summaries, or data products. Each prompt should include:

1. Title and short description.
2. Date executed and model used.
3. Link to the resulting artifact in `../reports/` or elsewhere in the repository.
4. Any follow-up clarifications or manual edits performed after model output.

Use `../templates/prompt-template.md` when adding new entries to maintain consistency.
